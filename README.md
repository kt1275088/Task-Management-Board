Task Details: Each task card includes details such as title, description, due date, assigned user, and labels.
Collaboration: Team members can collaborate on tasks by adding comments, attachments, and assigning tasks to individuals.
Notifications: Users receive notifications for task assignments, due dates, and comments on tasks they're involved in.
Search and Filter: Users can search for specific tasks and filter tasks based on criteria like status, due date, or assigned user.
